# Fast-Pay
This project addresses the persistent challenge of long queues and delays in university stores and marketplaces by proposing an innovative payment system leveraging Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology. The system aims to enhance transaction efficiency and reduce waiting times through the introduction of RFID-enabled cards and scanners. By integrating RFID scanners with facial recognition technology, the system ensures seamless and rapid transactions, promoting a cashless environment while maintaining offline security. Additionally, the system includes a monthly top-up mechanism via V-TOP, further enhancing convenience and accessibility for both students and staff. By tackling the identified problem, this project offers a comprehensive solution to streamline transactions, ultimately fostering a more efficient and convenient university shopping experience.
